# Intarnetto
Simple IoT server made with Python Bottle

## Current status
Temperature is displayed, windows are checked, lights get lit and unlit, you can enslave mpd. It works, I guess. But it needs some optimizations (like requests multithreading)

## Expectations
+ Show temperature
+ Show if a window (or door) is opened
+ Light some leds/lightbulbs up and turn 'em off
+ Control mpd
+ Maybe in the future add a doorbell with a camera and a log
